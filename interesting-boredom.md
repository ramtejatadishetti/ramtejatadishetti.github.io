# Interesting Boredom

As the title says, this page is about songs which sound/ very boring for the very first time, but after multiple iterations we like them.

P.S : Relative order doesn't indicate the quality of song 

####  Akkam Pakkam Paar

Little bit background to this song:

This song is a beautiful intersection of lifestyles of 2 different set of people.
It shows very simple things like daily chores we do, small pleasures which give us instant gratification and more specifically no superficial or glossy things,
just as simple as possible. Its an overdose of slow-motion shots but nonetheless those are moments which we enjoy doing in our daily routine life.
