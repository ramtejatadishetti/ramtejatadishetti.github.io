# Interesting Boredom

As the title says, this page is about songs which sound/ very boring for the very first time, but after multiple iterations we like them.

P.S : Relative order doesn't indicate the quality of song 

####  Akkam Pakkam Paar - Kadhalum Kadandhu Pogum

Little bit background to this song:

This song is a beautiful intersection of lifestyles of 2 different set of people.
It shows very simple things like daily chores we do, small pleasures which give us instant gratification and more specifically no superficial or glossy things,
just as simple as possible. Its an overdose of slow-motion shots but nonetheless those are moments which we enjoy doing in our daily routine life.




#### Kagidha Kappal â€“ Madras

[![Kagidha Kappal](https://img.youtube.com/vi/UlpVkEtb6w4/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlpVkEtb6w4)

We often feel down after a rejection. The reason we feel down as we assume that people who achieved are actually happier. In reality that really doesn't matter for the so called happiness. If we look closely at the scale of life all these rejections are just flashes. So its no brainer to feel disappointed. All we need to do is just keep our chin up and jump over barriers of rejection. Finally you might get what you thought was lost. This entire heavy message is spoken abstractly in a humorous tone. Tone and choreography makes it different from traditional inspirational songs.
